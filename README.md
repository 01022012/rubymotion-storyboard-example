Playing around with RubyMotion.

Ported a basic Storyboarded app based on these two articles:

Part 1: http://www.raywenderlich.com/50308/storyboards-tutorial-in-ios-7-part-1
Part 2: http://www.raywenderlich.com/50310/storyboards-tutorial-in-ios-7-part-2

Into a RubyMotion app using `ib` gem for interfacing with the storyboard / Interface Builder.

For extra credit I also implemented Player editing - which is not implemented in the above Obj-C app.
